Vantiv eCommerce Java SDK
=====================
#### Warning:
#### All version changes require recertification to the new version. Once certified for the use of a new version, Vantiv modifies your Merchant Profile, allowing you to submit transaction to the Production Environment using the new version. Updating your code without recertification and modification of your Merchant Profile will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.
